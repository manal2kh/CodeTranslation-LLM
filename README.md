Code TranslationBy LLM 
This project explores the impact of code refactoring on the accuracy and efficiency of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). The workflow is divided into two main phases. In the first phase, the source code is directly translated into the target programming language using an LLM. In the second phase, the same source code undergoes a refactoring process aimed at improving its structure, readability, and maintainability. The refactored code is then translated into the target language using the same LLM

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  

Set up your LLM API key in an environment file:
export LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
